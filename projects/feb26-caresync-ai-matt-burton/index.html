      <p class="meta">
        Built by <strong>Matt Burton</strong> –
        Capstone for "Become an Agentic Architect / Mastering Multiagent AI Systems with CrewAI".
      </p>
      <p>AI-powered platform for coordinating senior care across medical, financial, and legal domains — with multi-agent intelligence that turns family conversations into structured, actionable health data.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Problem &amp; Target Users</h2>
      <p>Caregiving coordination for aging parents is fragmented across texts, emails, phone calls, and memory. Critical details — medication changes, cognitive symptoms, doctor recommendations — get lost. Families burn out. Facilities field endless repeat calls.</p>
      <p>CareSync serves three stakeholders: <strong>senior living facilities</strong> (the customer), <strong>independent seniors</strong> managing their own health (age 65–85), and <strong>adult children</strong> coordinating a parent's care (age 45–65).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Solution Overview</h2>
      <p>CareSync is a B2B2C platform that centralizes all caregiving coordination in one place. Families communicate through two chat spaces — one transparent to the resident, one private for difficult conversations — while AI agents automatically extract health data, summarize conversations, and answer care questions with cited sources.</p>
      <p>The platform covers the full caregiving lifecycle: medical (health timeline, medications, cognitive tracking), financial (insurance, banking), and legal (estate documents, power of attorney, driving decisions).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Family Chat with AI Summaries</strong> — Two chat spaces (transparent + private) with CrewAI-powered conversation summarization, key point extraction, and action item identification.</li>
        <li><strong>Health Timeline</strong> — AI-extracted vitals, symptoms, medications, and cognitive incident tracking with confidence scores.</li>
        <li><strong>Calendar</strong> — Medical and personal events shared across the care team, color-coded by type.</li>
        <li><strong>Decisions Log</strong> — Audit trail of care decisions with context, reasoning, participants, and importance level.</li>
        <li><strong>Medications Tracker</strong> — Prescriber, pharmacy, dosage, and AI extraction from conversations.</li>
        <li><strong>Document Vault</strong> — Secure storage with OCR and AI-powered structured data extraction.</li>
        <li><strong>Care Team Directory</strong> — Provider contacts with specialty, organization, and interaction history.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal &amp; Financial Hub</strong> — Insurance policies, estate documents, banking info, and driving decisions in one place.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Multi-agent AI Crew</h2>
      <p>Three YAML-configured CrewAI agents process care data through a FastAPI microservice. Each agent operates independently with no delegation, ensuring predictable and auditable results. A DEMO_MODE toggle allows the system to return realistic mock data when no API key is configured.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Technical Architecture</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Frontend</strong> — Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, NextAuth.js</li>
        <li><strong>Backend</strong> — FastAPI (Python 3.12), CrewAI multi-agent framework, structured logging with structlog</li>
        <li><strong>Data / storage</strong> — PostgreSQL 16 via Prisma ORM (26 tables, multi-tenant with cascade deletes)</li>
        <li><strong>Integrations</strong> — OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (agent LLM), Whisper API (transcription), Google Vision / AWS Textract (OCR), S3 (file storage)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Deployment</h2>
      <p>The entire platform runs via <code>docker compose up --build</code>, launching three containers: PostgreSQL 16 (database), Next.js standalone (frontend on port 3000), and FastAPI/CrewAI (backend on port 8000). Prisma migrations and demo data seeding run automatically on container start. Designed for future cloud deployment on AWS or similar infrastructure.</p>

      <h2>My Role &amp; Learnings as Agentic Architect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed a YAML-driven agent configuration system that separates agent definitions from application code, making it easy to adjust agent behavior without code changes.</li>
        <li>Built a DEMO_MODE toggle pattern that returns realistic mock data when no LLM API key is available — essential for testing, demos, and CI/CD pipelines.</li>
        <li>Learned to structure CrewAI agents with <code>allow_delegation=false</code> for predictable, auditable results in a healthcare context where reliability matters more than agent autonomy.</li>
        <li>Containerized a full-stack multi-agent system (Next.js + FastAPI + PostgreSQL) with Docker Compose, including automatic database migrations and seed data on startup.</li>
        <li>Designed a multi-tenant B2B2C data model supporting three interface modes (Senior Dashboard, Family Platform, Facility Admin) with privacy controls that respect resident data sovereignty.</li>
